2.  Download the latest version.

## Repository Contents
This repository is not meant for users to build from source directly. Instead, it provides key components and information for the project, including:
- The latest memory **offsets**
- Project assets like the logo and icons
- A `requirements.txt` file listing the Python libraries used during development

---

> [!WARNING]
> Known issues:
> - Box ESP overlay can bug a bit, but this is mostly fixed by just turning it off and on.
> - Spamming the Controller will break it.
> - Toggle-off off feature isn't fully flushed out yet.

> [!TIP]
> Extras: 
> It needs to be run as an admin so the keybinds can work as best they can at this moment. The software is fully external and only reads from the game's memory and does not write.
